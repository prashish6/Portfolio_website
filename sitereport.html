                <h2>Development Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey in programming and web development has been diverse and enriching. I started with Python, creating 
                    practical applications like a Book Ordering System using Tkinter GUI. This project taught me the fundamentals 
                    of object-oriented programming, user interface design, and database management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then developed utility applications like a BMI Calculator and a Light Year to Kilometer Converter, which helped 
                    me understand input validation, mathematical computations, and user experience design. These projects, though smaller 
                    in scope, were crucial in building my confidence with Python programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most recently, I ventured into web development with this portfolio project. Learning HTML and CSS has been both 
                    challenging and rewarding. The transition from desktop applications to web development introduced me to new concepts 
                    like responsive design, CSS Grid, and modern web styling techniques.

                <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
                <p>
                    For the portfolio website, I chose a dark theme with #121212 as the background color and #1e1e1e for content areas.
                    The primary accent color #0066cc provides good contrast and visual hierarchy. This color scheme reduces eye strain
                    and creates a modern, professional look that's becoming increasingly popular in development environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The layout was designed with a focus on showcasing my projects effectively. I used CSS Grid for the projects page 
                    to create a responsive card layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The contact form was designed to be 
                    user-friendly with clear labels and appropriate spacing. The video demonstration page uses a responsive iframe 
                    to ensure proper video display across devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typography choices were made with readability in mind. Segoe UI was selected as the primary font for its clean, 
                    modern appearance and excellent readability on both dark and light backgrounds. The spacing and hierarchy in the 
                    text elements help guide users through the content naturally.

                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    The website is built using pure HTML5 and CSS3, demonstrating core web development skills without relying on 
                    frameworks. Key technical features include:

                <ul style="list-style: none; margin: 1rem 0; color: #b0b0b0;">
                    <li>• Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox</li>
                    <li>• Mobile-first approach with media queries</li>
                    <li>• Semantic HTML structure for better accessibility</li>
                    <li>• CSS animations for interactive elements</li>
                    <li>• Optimized images and performance considerations</li>
